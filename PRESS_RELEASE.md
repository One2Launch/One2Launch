# One2Launch: Breaking Barriers to Digital Entrepreneurship

## üöÄ The Problem

The rise of e-commerce has created unprecedented opportunities for aspiring entrepreneurs. With the right tools, anyone can launch an online business, manage operations from a smartphone, and reach a global audience. However, these opportunities are not equally accessible. While some entrepreneurs thrive in this digital landscape, others‚Äîparticularly those from low-income, immigrant, and minority backgrounds‚Äîface systemic barriers that make success far more difficult.

### The reality is stark:

- **29% of low-income households** (under $30,000) lack broadband access, compared to just **3% of higher-income households**. *(Pew Research Center, 2021)*
- **58% of low-wage workers** lack the digital skills needed to effectively leverage online business tools. *(National Skills Coalition, 2020)*
- **Black and Latino entrepreneurs are 2‚Äì3 times more likely to be denied business loans**, even when controlling for financial metrics. *(Kauffman Foundation, 2022)*
- **Tech-driven businesses remain disproportionately owned by privileged individuals**, leaving many underrepresented founders at a disadvantage. *(Brookings Institution, 2023)*

These disparities highlight a **digital divide that extends beyond internet access**; it includes financial barriers, gaps in business education, and a lack of mentorship or networks that are often critical to success.

As it stands, existing e-commerce ecosystem assume a baseline level of **digital literacy, financial flexibility, and business acumen** that many individuals simply do not have access to. While privileged entrepreneurs benefit from **generational knowledge, financial backing, and industry connections**, underprivileged entrepreneurs must navigate more hurdles in figuring out their business logistics. Without tailored solutions that acknowledge these barriers, the digital economy will continue to exclude those who need it most, **widening the wealth gap and reinforcing systemic inequality**.

## TL;DR:

E-commerce has revolutionized business opportunities, but **systemic disparities in digital literacy, financial access, and business education prevent many aspiring entrepreneurs from participating**. The issue isn‚Äôt a lack of talent or drive‚Äî it‚Äôs a lack of **accessible, inclusive solutions** that lower the barriers to entry.

# Summary

Over the past decade, the expansion of online business tools has enabled millions of entrepreneurs to start and scale their ventures. Yet, despite these advancements, research shows that access to these opportunities remains uneven.

Despite these barriers, underprivileged communities continue to demonstrate immense entrepreneurial spirit, finding innovative ways to build businesses despite systemic limitations. The challenge lies in creating a digital platform that recognizes these realities and provides a **streamlined, accessible, and approachable** entry point into digital commerce.

A tailored, all-in-one e-commerce solution offering simplified setup, flexibility to customize solutions, and integrated business logistics services such as payment processing, shipping, and invoicing could help bridge this gap. By designing with accessibility and inclusion in mind, we can empower talented entrepreneurs to thrive in the digital economy, ensuring that economic mobility is truly available to all.

# Our Hypothesis

If an all-in-one, accessible e-commerce platform were designed with the needs of underrepresented entrepreneurs in mind, it would significantly lower barriers to entry and create more equitable economic opportunities. By addressing systemic challenges with a platform, rather than placing the burden solely on individuals to "figure it out," we can empower more entrepreneurs to participate in the digital economy, ensuring that economic mobility is truly available to all.
